# Stepik

Notes on our entries. http://adaptive.stepik.org/ Submit before 11 Feb 2017.

## Content

* 30-60 mins of study
* at least 20 practical lessons plus a few lessons with theory
* Each practical lesson should have only 1-3 assignments. If there are more than 1 assignments, they should be of the same difficulty.
* Please create lessons that are not directly and tightly connected. We will recommend your lessons to learners selectively and sometimes in arbitrary order, therefore each lesson should represent a single complete concept.

## Subjects
Any content on software development, computer science and data science.

* Data Science : statistics, data processing and visualization, machine learning and artificial intelligence, deep learning
* Theoretical Computer Science : algorithms, data structures, type theory, compilers and programming languages theory, complexity theory
* Applied Computer Science : databases, networks, security, graphics, parallel and distributed systems, software architecture
* Python : from basic programming to advanced language features and frameworks (and beautiful is better than ugly)
* Java : from basic programming to advanced language features and frameworks
* Javascript : from basic programming to advanced language features and frameworks (WAT?)



## I wish I had a server named Francis!

### To Do
* Rewrite into two: Summary / About Course
* Make lessons for each
* probably way too long, divide in half

### Summary / About Course
Cloud Computing Basics! The first steps to becoming a master at your own server. Setting up a secure EC2 server on Amazon AWS, using command line, SSH, Git, configuring an Nginx web server, setting up your first database with MySQL, and more! Get introduced to Network Security, Versioning, Linux, Databases, System Architecture, Web Hosting, and all the backend shenanigans necessary for making the most use of Computing power. Use this as legs into Data Science, Distributed systems, Programming, Full Stack deployment, your own personal website, Machine Learning, and way, way more.
